## Workshop on data security - NeurIPS 2020

A workshop to address major issues that arise in dataset curation and security. Classicalmachine learning research has been focused largely on models,  optimizers,  and computational challenges. As technical progress and hardware advancements ease these challenges, practitioners are now finding that the limitations and faults of their models are the result of their datasets. This is particularly true of deep networks, which often rely on huge datasets that are too large and unwieldy for domain experts to curate by hand.
